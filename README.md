LAHMC
=====

Implements Look Ahead Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (LAHMC) and standard 
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) in both Python and MATLAB.

LAHMC is described in the paper:
  Sohl-Dickstein, Jascha and Mudigonda, Mayur and DeWeese, Michael R.
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Without Detailed Balance.
  International Conference on Machine Learning. 2014

Code reproducing Figure 2 and Table 1 of the paper, and demonstrating
usage of the sampler, can be found in python/generate_figure_2.py and
matlab/generate_figure_2.m.
